          TestifyAI is a website suitable for phones, computers, and tablets.
          This app lets you take a test on anything you want and allows you to
          choose both the difficulty and the number of questions.
        </p>
        <p className="mb-4">
          The information for each test is processed by an AI, which searches
          for the topic, learns about it, and then creates a question with four
          possible answersâ€”only one of which is correct. After each question,
          you can view the explanation of the correct answer.
        </p>
        <p className="mb-4">
          Because the content is generated by AI, there may occasionally be
          mistakes in the questions or answers. If you notice any issues or
          have feedback, please contact us at:
